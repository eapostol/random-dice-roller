# Enhanced Dice Rolling Application

This is an enhanced Dice Rolling Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to roll a virtual dice and get a random number between 1 and 6 for each die. Additionally, it now supports rolling a value of 1 and includes scalable dice.

## Features

- Roll a dice to get a random number between 1 and 6, including 1.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Scalable dice that can adjust in size.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice.
3. The result will be displayed on the screen.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the application.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that contains the styles for the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for rolling the dice.

## How It Works

The application uses JavaScript to generate a random number between 1 and 6, including 1, when the "Roll Dice" button is clicked. The result is then displayed on the screen. The code has been refactored for better performance and readability. The dice can also scale in size based on user interaction.
